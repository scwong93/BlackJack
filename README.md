## About
This is a project built with Python that's ran entirely in the command line. During the course of the game, you will have the opportunity to wager a bet, choose to Hit or Stand on your turn, and win/lose chips depending on the results. Once the turn is over, you will be able to play again if you choose to do so.

## If I had more time...
I would integrate a frontend to this project to give the user a more visually enhancing experience. Instead of display words such as 'Two of Hearts', I would display an actual image of the card. I would also include a background image of a table, with the dealer and player picture option. Integrating audio functionally would definitely be considered down the line.
